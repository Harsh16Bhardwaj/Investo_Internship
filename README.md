# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive pricing component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers.

## My process

### Built with

- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox (for layout)
- CSS (for custom styles)

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of **TypeScript**, including its type safety features and how it integrates with React. I also strengthened my ability to create responsive layouts using **Flexbox**, ensuring the application works seamlessly across various screen sizes and shapes.

One key takeaway was mastering the art of creating layouts that maintain consistency and adaptability, especially when working with dynamic content like sliders and toggles.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to expand the project by:

- Implementing multiple color themes for the pricing component, allowing users to toggle between them.
- Further refining the responsiveness and ensuring an even smoother experience across all devices and screen sizes.

### Useful resources

No external resources were used for this challenge as I followed the provided instructions and built the solution based on my own research and understanding.
